# AI Project
In this prject, we have explored different methods of data imputation, and, their accuracies in real world data sets. 
We have used a random forest model found online. In the data sets provided in this model, we have first created instances of missing data by a simple python script in CreatingFaultyDataSet.ipynb file.
After this, we have filled these missing values using different methods like K-Nearest Neighbours, Mean, Mode, Median and Bayesian Ridge, and stored these in different csv files.
Now we have simply used the model on these different data sets, to get results, and then, compared these results to find the most effective method of Data Munging.
